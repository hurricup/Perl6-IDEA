#Perl6 plugin for IntellijIDEA

This is my attempt to build aplugin for IDEA that will support Perl6 language.

I used Groovy IDEA plugin as an example. 

This project is currently in development, and if you want to participate - welcome.

Simultaneously i've created same plugn for Perl5, because i'm really better familiar with it. But i'll try to keep both plugins up to date.
